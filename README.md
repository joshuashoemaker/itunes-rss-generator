# itunes-rss-generator
Node.js and Mongo DB app for generating itunes RSS feeds.

Runs off of localhost port 3000.

As of right now this app just allows you to create a channel and add episodes to it. Future plans are to allow for deleting episodes and channels, editing information after it has been submitted, forcing the user to enter info in the correct format with intuitive and not invasive forms, and eventualy making the UI prettier.

Once completeed I will be using this app as part of a free podcast hosting service that allows file uploads and community database with apssword protection.
